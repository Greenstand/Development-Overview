# Tree Token Creation
 
## Core principle: 
- A value system derived from the physical act of verifying tree survival.
- A value system that rewards people responsible for tree survival.

## Core ideas: 
- The token has a market-driven value. 
- All tokens are backed by tree verification(s). 
- One can own fractions of tree impact with tokens.
- Greenstand sets and maintains tree validation standard.
- Validated trees on Greenstand platform produce tokens that are assigned to a users digital wallet.
- Tokens can be bought, sold and traded (token economics) independent of Greenstand.
- The network of reforestation organizations and their respecitve commmunity of supporters would determine value of tree tokens.   

# Tree Token Value at Creation

## Current system 
- 1 token = one tree verification (Geotagged time-stamped image of a tree).
- Creation Limit = 1 per tree per 28 days cycle.

Greenstand is paying tree planters in local currency per token 

### Current Shortcomings 
This system doesn't account for:
- Environmental Challenges
- Special trees
- Species diversity
- Delays in tracking

For example, Sarah tracks their Baobab tree once every 3 months and receives one token each time they track at 3.5 cents for an awesome tree that is challenging to keep alive. 

### Possible Solution:

### Seed Tokens and Filler tokens

#### Seed Token:
An update verification of a tree that can spawn interim tokens.
 
#### Filler Tokens:
An interim token fabricated by a lapse in two seed tokens.  
Filler Tokens:
  - Have a reduction factor of 'x' to incentivize tracking
  - Can not be fabricated by two separate planters
  - Can not be generated 'x' months after a Seed Token
  - Must link to corresponding Seed Token Verification updates
Number of tokens = months since last verification of that tree?

### Value Factor
An algorithm allowing one tree verification to create multiple tokens: # tokens = tree update * (Value Factor).

Value Factor compensates for:
  - unique environmental challenges
  - Species diversity
  - Unique Species 
  - Other ecological value
  - Other challanges

### Flagged tokens (dead trees, duplicates, miss matched) are removed from the system, credited to the buyers account and planters 'account payable' is debited.
